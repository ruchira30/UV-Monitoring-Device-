# UV-Monitoring-Device

A microcontroller-based system that tracks and monitors users' UV exposure, securely transmitting data to the cloud using Firebase. The device integrates a UV sensor (S12D) with an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module for real-time data collection and transmission. The system integrates a UV sensor (S12D) with an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module to facilitate real-time data collection and transmission. The microcontroller, programmed in C/C++ (Arduino), is responsible for handling sensor readings and managing communication with Firebase. Data is updated every 15 seconds, allowing for timely collection and continuous monitoring. The collected data is visualized and analyzed, providing users with a clear understanding of their UV exposure levels.
